cfgsystem_build_config
------------------------------------

This small utility is able to read all the configurations
managed by ietf-system model and display them. They
actually represent the startup configuration and it
should be much easier to start using cfgsystem module
on a preconfigured machine using this application.

Usage:
	cfgsystem_build_config <cfgsystem.so path>
