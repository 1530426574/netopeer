Use on your own risk, it can harm your system configuration files.

cfgsystem.so
------------

TransAPI module primarily intended for the Netopeer server, but in general
for libnetconf based NETCONF servers. The module should correctly work on
RHEL, SUSE and Debian based distros.

Install
~~~~~~~

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

configure options:

--with-netopeer-confdir=DIR

  If you changed the sysconfdir of the Netopeer server, please reflect
  this change in this option. By default, the Netopeer server stores its
  configuration files in ${sysconfdir}/netopeer/ directory. Instead of the
  complete path, you can alternatively specify the sysconfdir value
  (--sysconfdir=DIR) in the same way as in case of the Netopeer server.

Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module implements ietf-system data model as defined in
ietf-netmod-system-mgmt-16 draft from May 14, 2014. It implements only the
folowing features of the data model:

- authentication - configuration of the user authentication by manipulating
  with the sshd_config of SSH daemon listening for the NETCONF connections.
- local-users - configuration of local user authentication by manipulating
  with the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys files.
- ntp - configuration of usage NTP server(s) by manipulating with
  /etc/ntp.conf file and the ntp (or ntpd on RHEL based distros) service.
- timezone-name - allows timezone configuration using TZ database.

The module also allows configuration of
- DNS resolver by manipulating with the /etc/resolv.conf.

For the detailed description of content for the specific configuration
element, please read the ietf-netmod-system-mgmt-16 draft.


cfgsystem-init
--------------

This small utility is able to load all the configurations managed by the 
ietf-system model and store them as the startup configuration data for use
in the netopeer-server.

The tool is automatically used with 'make install' when the Netopeer server
(netopeer-manager(1) is already installed, so after that you don't need to run
it manually.

Remember, that having empty startup datastore on netopeer-server startup with
the cfgsystem module enabled causes removing all current configuration settings
(NTP and DNS servers, users,...)!
 
Usage:
	./cfgsystem-init <cfgsystem's datastore path>
