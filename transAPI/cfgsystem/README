This part of the Netopeer project is not finished and it is not intended for
public usage, YET.

Use on your own risk, it can harm your system configuration files.


cfgsystem-init
--------------

This small utility is able to load all the configurations managed by the 
ietf-system model and store them as the startup configuration data for use
in the netopeer-server.

The tool is automatically used with 'make install', so after that you don't
need to run it manually.

Remember, that having empty startup datastore on netopeer-server startup with
the cfgsystem module enabled causes removing all current configuration settings
(NTP and DNS servers, users,...)!
 
Usage:
	./cfgsystem-init <cfgsystem's datastore path>
