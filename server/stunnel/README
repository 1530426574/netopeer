Generating certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: All certificates in this directory are only examples!

Create self-signed CA certificate:
openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048 -des3
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem

Create a peer certificate signed by own CA:
openssl genrsa -out peer.key 2048
openssl req -new -key peer.key -out peer.csr
openssl x509 -req -in peer.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out peer.crt -days 500
